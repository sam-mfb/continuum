Zephyrs Descriptions one  page  and  a  little  bit  of  rattling  on about  how  great  we  areWhere the word 'help' comes into play.1 The Sixteen-Sided Die: It gets gradually harder due to the firing rate and other, more complex things.2 Boxed In: No real problem.3 Lunar Lander: Yeah, I know-- that one killer wall is a BITCH. But hey, if you can't handle it...4 Gasblaster: Thrust, man, thrust!5 Master of the Gun: Get the guys on the left first (heh). It was mainly designed to be a cutesie, and I didn't have the heart to throw it away.6 Take It Slow: Really: you don't have a choice. As you might guess, Vernon did it. AND JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL... you missed something. 7 Pipeline: Geez, only 129? But I had plans...8 English Cross: Theres only one way to do this one...9 Skyline: The city at night can just suck you in, sometimes.10 Long Train Runnin': Therz two ways of attackin this: 1) Don't thrust and realise how badly ye screwed up, or 2) Push the thrust key down to the floor.11 Sidewinder Version One- Vertical: DO NOT just let yourself float about. Grabbing all the fuel at once may be a mistake as well. (Yes, I know this sounds like a horoscope.) This was primarily an experiment that ballooned, much like the entire document.12 Fast Draw I: 'Guns Galore': Runner-up for the 'most fuel used in one level' award. As you might guess, try to conserve fuel; and keep shooting at regular intervals. 13 Circulus Diabolus: Probability suggests that if you keep one finger on the 'Rotate Right' key, and another pressing, at regular intervals, the 'fire' key, that you will hit every one of those guns eventually. You would really be surprised how right probability is.14 More Than Angry: Thats what Chazz was when he tried it out-- more than angry. To get past this, you will need to use everything you know about the laws governing Continuum, and if you still can't figure it out, call (713) 483-3111. Unquestionably, they will be able to help. By the by, don't call collect, they get mad if you do that.15 Ship Mould: No, not like breadmould, stupid. Encasement. This underwent lotsa testing, so trust me. Everything there can, indeed, be shot. Eventually.16 Death By Wind III- Aftermath, 2013 A.D.: The things Chazz loves the most are those squareguns.17 Edge of Sight. This is, honest to various deities, possible with one ship-- this level introduced yet another new (to us, of course) bit of the physics in Continuum. I won't say what it is, of course, but I think it's fairly obvious to those who don't react A.S.A. the level pops onto your screen.          JBPhelps/Lord Thomas          VPBrandt/Chazz Shadow
