# Ship Module

Handles player ship state management, physics simulation, and collision detection. Manages ship movement, rotation, fuel consumption, lives, and flame effects.

## Key Files

- `shipSlice.ts` - Redux slice for ship state management
- `checkFigure.ts` - Ship collision detection and boundary checking
- `physics/` - Ship physics simulation (thrust, rotation, gravity)
- `render/` - Ship rendering and visual effects
- `types.ts` - Ship-related type definitions
- `constants.ts` - Ship physics and game constants

## Original Source

Based on original ship logic from `orig/Sources/Ship.c` and related ship handling files.
