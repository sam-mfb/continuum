This document explains the complex wall drawing system used in the original Continuum game, including how walls are rendered with 3D effects and how intersections (junctions) are handled.

## Plain English Summary: How Wall Drawing Works

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how Continuum draws its 3D-looking walls:

### The Basic Idea

Imagine each wall as a raised platform. To make it look 3D on a 2D screen, each wall has two parts:

1. First, a white "underside" underneath (like the underside of a platform)
2. Then, a black "top surface" on top

This creates the illusion that walls stick up from the playing field.

### The Three-Step Process

The wall system works in three distinct steps:

1. **Organization** (at level start) - Prepare everything for fast drawing
2. **Selection** (each frame) - Figure out what's visible
3. **Drawing** (each frame) - Render the visible walls efficiently

Let's look at each step in detail:

#### Step 1: **Organization** (One-time setup when level loads)

This step prepares all the data structures for efficient rendering:

- **Categorize walls**: Sort walls into groups by their behavior type (normal, bouncing, phantom walls)
- **Sort by position**: Arrange walls by x-coordinate for fast visibility checking
- **Find all junctions**: Locate every place where walls end, deduplicating endings that are within 3px of each other
- **Create white shadow pieces**: Generate the white "underside" pieces for each wall endpoint
- **Calculate junction patches**: Figure out special filler pieces to make junctions look clean
- **Identify optimization opportunities**: Mark which parts of walls require more expensive XOR drawing and which can be drawing more simply
- **Merge and sort white pieces**: Combine overlapping pieces and sort for efficient access

#### Step 2: **Selection** (Every frame - find what's visible)

The game efficiently determines which walls need drawing:

- **Use viewport bounds**: Check against the player's current view area (512Ã—318 pixels)
- **Exploit pre-sorting**: Since walls are sorted by x-position:
  - Skip past walls entirely to the left of the screen
  - Stop once we reach walls that start past the right edge
- **Check each candidate**: For walls that might be visible, verify they overlap the screen
- **Include margins**: Add small buffers (10 pixels horizontal, 6 vertical) to catch walls partially off-screen

#### Step 3: **Drawing** (Every frame - render the visible walls)

With the visible walls identified, render them in the correct order:

- **Fast phase first**:

  - Draw all pre-rendered pieces for visible walls
  - Add crosshatch patterns at junctions
  - Handle special cases (like NNE walls that need white-only treatment)

- **Complicated phase second**:
  - Use optimized combined drawing where possible (no nearby junctions) that draw white and black together
  - In areas requiring complex drawing use XOR operations
  - Process each wall category separately (phantom, bouncing, normal)
  - Handle world wrapping by drawing walls twice if needed
